Hello, I am Octoomy (Using nickname for privacy sake), a person from Ohio, been interested in coding and similar since I was 8. Started off with simple scripting from VBS and Batch, then discovering a range of programming languages, those being Python, Golang and Java. To set back further, since the age of 6, I was interested in computers, because of me playing flash games on the website Kongregate and Miniclip. The only game I really remember playing though was Dune Buggy.
